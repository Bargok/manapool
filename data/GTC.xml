If neither stat of the new creature is greater, evolve won't trigger at all. <br>4/15/2013 : If evolve triggers, the stat comparison will happen again when the ability tries to resolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, the ability will do nothing. If the creature that entered the battlefield leaves the battlefield before evolve tries to resolve, use its last known power and toughness to compare the stats. <br>4/15/2013 : If a creature enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, consider those counters when determining if evolve will trigger. For example, a 1/1 creature that enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it will cause the evolve ability of a 2/2 creature to trigger. <br>4/15/2013 : If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may trigger multiple times, although the stat comparison will take place each time one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with evolve, so that ability does nothing. <br>4/15/2013 : When comparing the stats as the evolve ability resolves, it's possible that the stat that's greater changes from power to toughness or vice versa. If this happens, the ability will still resolve and you'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and a 1/3 creature enters the battlefield under your control, it toughness is greater so evolve will trigger. In response, the 1/3 creature gets +2/-2. When the evolve trigger tries to resolve, its power is greater. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[366294]]></id><name><![CDATA[Aerial Maneuver]]></name><set><![CDATA[GTC]]></set><type><![CDATA[Instant]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{1}{W}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[2]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Target creature gets +1/+1 and gains flying and first strike until end of turn.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA["When you put all of yourself into an attack, without fear or hesitation, in that instant you may attain greatness."<br>—Predak, Gateless freemage]]></flavor><artist><![CDATA[Scott Chou]]></artist><number><![CDATA[1]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[366273]]></id><name><![CDATA[Ætherize]]></name><set><![CDATA[GTC]]></set><type><![CDATA[Instant]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[U]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{3}{U}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[4]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Return all attacking creatures to their owner's hand.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA["You can come back once you've learned some manners—and figured out how to reconstitute your physical forms."]]></flavor><artist><![CDATA[Ryan Barger]]></artist><number><![CDATA[29]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[<br>1/24/2013 : An “attacking creature” is one that has been declared as an attacker this combat, or one that was put onto the battlefield attacking this combat.

Even though he’s indestructible, if Gideon, Champion of Justice has no loyalty counters on him, he’s put into his owner’s graveyard as a state-based action. <br>1/24/2013 : Gideon, Champion of Justice’s second ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human and Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: Gideon is just a planeswalker type (not a creature type), and Human and Soldier are just creature types (not planeswalker types). <br>1/24/2013 : If you activate Gideon, Champion of Justice’s second ability and then a creature enters the battlefield as a copy of him, that copy will be just a planeswalker, not a creature. (The effect of Gideon’s second ability isn’t copied, just as the effect of a Giant Growth, for example, wouldn’t be copied.) Since both permanents will be planeswalkers with the planeswalker type Gideon, each one will be put into his owner’s graveyard as a state-based action due to the “planeswalker uniqueness rule.” <br>1/24/2013 : If you activate Gideon, Champion of Justice’s second ability and then a permanent that’s already on the battlefield becomes a copy of him, that copy will be just a planeswalker, not a creature. If the first Gideon, Champion of Justice is still on the battlefield by the time the copy effect happens, each of those permanents will be put into his owner’s graveyard as a state-based action due to the “planeswalker uniqueness rule.” If the first Gideon, Champion of Justice is gone by this time, the other permanent will be put into his owner’s graveyard as a state-based action for having no loyalty counters on him (unless, for some odd reason, he already had loyalty counters on him). <br>1/24/2013 : Say you activate Gideon, Champion of Justice’s second ability, and then an opponent gains control of him before combat.

For example, a 1/1 creature that enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it will cause the evolve ability of a 2/2 creature to trigger. <br>4/15/2013 : If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may trigger multiple times, although the stat comparison will take place each time one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with evolve, so that ability does nothing. <br>4/15/2013 : When comparing the stats as the evolve ability resolves, it's possible that the stat that's greater changes from power to toughness or vice versa. If this happens, the ability will still resolve and you'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and a 1/3 creature enters the battlefield under your control, it toughness is greater so evolve will trigger. In response, the 1/3 creature gets +2/-2. When the evolve trigger tries to resolve, its power is greater. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[366445]]></id><name><![CDATA[Hands of Binding]]></name><set><![CDATA[GTC]]></set><type><![CDATA[Sorcery]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{1}{U}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[2]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Tap target creature an opponent controls.
