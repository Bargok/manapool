If neither stat of the new creature is greater, evolve won't trigger at all. <br>4/15/2013 : If evolve triggers, the stat comparison will happen again when the ability tries to resolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, the ability will do nothing. If the creature that entered the battlefield leaves the battlefield before evolve tries to resolve, use its last known power and toughness to compare the stats. <br>4/15/2013 : If a creature enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, consider those counters when determining if evolve will trigger. For example, a 1/1 creature that enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it will cause the evolve ability of a 2/2 creature to trigger. <br>4/15/2013 : If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may trigger multiple times, although the stat comparison will take place each time one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with evolve, so that ability does nothing. <br>4/15/2013 : When comparing the stats as the evolve ability resolves, it's possible that the stat that's greater changes from power to toughness or vice versa. If this happens, the ability will still resolve and you'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and a 1/3 creature enters the battlefield under your control, it toughness is greater so evolve will trigger. In response, the 1/3 creature gets +2/-2. When the evolve trigger tries to resolve, its power is greater. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[369063]]></id><name><![CDATA[Beck // Call]]></name><set><![CDATA[DGM]]></set><type><![CDATA[Sorcery // Sorcery]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[R // R]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{G}{U} // {4}{W}{U}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[2 // 6]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Whenever a creature enters the battlefield this turn, you may draw a card.<br> // <br>Put four 1/1 white Bird creature tokens with flying onto the battlefield.<br><br>Fuse (You may cast one or both halves of this card from your hand.)]]></ability><flavor></flavor><artist><![CDATA[Adam Paquette // Adam Paquette]]></artist><number><![CDATA[123]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[<br>4/15/2013 : If you’re casting a split card with fuse from any zone other than your hand, you can’t cast both halves.

For example, if the player’s life total is 4 when the last ability resolves, it will cause that player to lose 3 life. Other effects that interact with life loss (or gain) will interact with this effect accordingly. <br>4/15/2013 : Assigning no combat damage isn’t the same as preventing that damage.

You may also pay alternative costs, such as overload costs. Although you can’t pay additional costs for the copy that’s created, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target. <br>4/15/2013 : Melek’s last ability will copy any instant or sorcery spell you cast from your library, not just one with targets. <br>4/15/2013 : When the last ability resolves, it creates a copy of the spell.

The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities. <br>4/15/2013 : The copy will have the same targets as the spell it’s copying unless you choose new ones.

For example, suppose Progenitor Mimic enters the battlefield as a copy of Runeclaw Bear, a 2/2 green Bear creature with mana cost {1}{G}. The resulting object is a 2/2 green Bear creature named Runeclaw Bear with mana cost {1}{G} and with “At the beginning of your upkeep, if this creature isn’t a token, put a token onto the battlefield that’s a copy of this creature.” If another Progenitor Mimic enters the battlefield as a copy of that creature, it will be a Runeclaw Bear with two instances of the triggered ability. <br>4/15/2013 : If the chosen creature is a token, Progenitor Mimic copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield.

While the spell is on the stack, its converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in both costs. <br>4/15/2013 : You can choose the same object as the target of each half of a fused split spell, if appropriate. <br>4/15/2013 : When resolving a fused split spell with multiple targets, treat it as you would any spell with multiple targets. If all targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, the spell is countered and none of its effects happen. If at least one target is still legal at that time, the spell resolves, but an illegal target can’t perform any actions or have any actions performed on it. <br>4/15/2013 : When a fused split spell resolves, follow the instructions of the left half first, then the instructions on the right half. <br>4/15/2013 : In every zone except the stack, split cards have two sets of characteristics and two converted mana costs. If anything needs information about a split card not on the stack, it will get two values. <br>4/15/2013 : On the stack, a split spell that hasn’t been fused has only that half’s characteristics and converted mana cost. The other half is treated as though it didn’t exist. <br>4/15/2013 : Some split cards with fuse have two monocolor halves of different colors. If such a card is cast as a fused split spell, the resulting spell is multicolored. If only one half is cast, the spell is the color of that half.

That card goes directly from the stack to exile. It never goes to the graveyard. <br>4/15/2013 : You choose the creature as the spell resolves. The cipher ability doesn't target that creature, although the spell with cipher may target that creature (or a different creature) because of its other abilities. <br>4/15/2013 : If the spell with cipher is countered, none of its effects will happen, including cipher. The card will go to its owner's graveyard and won't be encoded on a creature. <br>4/15/2013 : If the creature leaves the battlefield, the exiled card will no longer be encoded on any creature. It will stay exiled. <br>4/15/2013 : If you want to encode the card with cipher onto a noncreature permanent such as a Keyrune that can turn into a creature, that permanent has to be a creature before the spell with cipher starts resolving. You can choose only a creature to encode the card onto. <br>4/15/2013 : The copy of the card with cipher is created in and cast from exile. <br>4/15/2013 : You cast the copy of the card with cipher during the resolution of the triggered ability. Ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type. <br>4/15/2013 : If you choose not to cast the copy, or you can't cast it (perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the copy will cease to exist the next time state-based actions are performed. You won't get a chance to cast the copy at a later time. <br>4/15/2013 : The exiled card with cipher grants a triggered ability to the creature it's encoded on. If that creature loses that ability and subsequently deals combat damage to a player, the triggered ability won't trigger. However, the exiled card will continue to be encoded on that creature. <br>4/15/2013 : If another player gains control of the creature, that player will control the triggered ability. That player will create a copy of the encoded card and may cast it. <br>4/15/2013 : If a creature with an encoded card deals combat damage to more than one player simultaneously (perhaps because some of the combat damage was redirected), the triggered ability will trigger once for each player it deals combat damage to. Each ability will create a copy of the exiled card and allow you to cast it. <br>4/15/2013 : Trait Doctoring changes the color word or basic land type each time it appears in the permanent’s type line and/or rules text. It doesn’t change the name of the card or any instances of the word being used as part of a card’s name. <br>4/15/2013 : You choose what word you’re changing and what word you’re changing it to as Trait Doctoring resolves. <br>4/15/2013 : You can target any permanent with Trait Doctoring, including one with no color words or basic land types on it. <br>4/15/2013 : Trait Doctoring’s effect changes only the text printed on the permanent. It can’t change words found in abilities it’s been granted. For example, if you’ve changed “green” to “blue,” and the permanent gains protection from green (as opposed to having protection from green printed on it), that protection ability is unaffected. The permanent will have protection from green. <br>4/15/2013 : If the basic land type of a land is changed, the associated mana ability of that land will also change, but its name will not. For example, if you’ve changed “Plains” to “Island,” a card named Plains will have the basic land type Island and can be tapped for {U}, and it can no longer be tapped for {W}. <br>4/15/2013 : The type-changing effect can change part of a word such as “nonblack” or “swampwalk” if the part of the word is being used to refer to a color or basic land type.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[369072]]></id><name><![CDATA[Trostani's Summoner]]></name><set><![CDATA[DGM]]></set><type><![CDATA[Creature — Elf Shaman]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[U]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{5}{G}{W}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[7]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[1]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[1]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[When Trostani's Summoner enters the battlefield, put a 2/2 white Knight creature token with vigilance, a 3/3 green Centaur creature token, and a 4/4 green Rhino creature token with trample onto the battlefield.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[]]></flavor><artist><![CDATA[Howard Lyon]]></artist><number><![CDATA[110]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[369046]]></id><name><![CDATA[Ubul Sar Gatekeepers]]></name><set><![CDATA[DGM]]></set><type><![CDATA[Creature — Zombie Soldier]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{3}{B}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[4]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[2]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[4]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[When Ubul Sar Gatekeepers enters the battlefield, if you control two or more Gates, target creature an opponent controls gets -2/-2 until end of turn.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[There are many gates into the undercity, but few ways out.]]></flavor><artist><![CDATA[Volkan Baga]]></artist><number><![CDATA[30]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[369010]]></id><name><![CDATA[Uncovered Clues]]></name><set><![CDATA[DGM]]></set><type><![CDATA[Sorcery]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{2}{U}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[3]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Look at the top four cards of your library.
