This is called the "planeswalking ability." <br>10/1/2009 : A face-up plane card that's turned face down becomes a new object with no relation to its previous existence. In particular, it loses all counters it may have had. <br>10/1/2009 : The controller of a face-up plane card is the player designated as the "planar controller." Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn't leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game.

Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully. <br>10/1/2009 : Academy at Tolaria West's first ability has an "intervening 'if' clause." That means (1) the ability won't trigger at all unless you have no cards in hand as your end step begins, and (2) the ability will do nothing unless you have no cards in hand by the time it resolves. <br>10/1/2009 : If you discard your hand as a result of rolling {C}, Academy at Tolaria West's first ability will then trigger at the beginning of your end step (unless you planeswalk or somehow put a card in your hand before then).]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[198090]]></id><name><![CDATA[Agyrem]]></name><set><![CDATA[PCP]]></set><type><![CDATA[Plane — Ravnica]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[0]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Whenever a white creature dies, return it to the battlefield under its owner's control at the beginning of the next end step.<br>Whenever a nonwhite creature dies, return it to its owner's hand at the beginning of the next end step.<br>Whenever you roll {C}, creatures can't attack you until a player planeswalks.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[]]></flavor><artist><![CDATA[Todd Lockwood]]></artist><number><![CDATA[3]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[<br>10/1/2009 : A plane card is treated as if its text box included "When you roll {PW}, put this card on the bottom of its owner's planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar deck off that planar deck and turn it face up."

Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully. <br>10/1/2009 : Agyrem's first and second abilities each set up a delayed triggered ability. These abilities will trigger at the beginning of the next end step even if Agyrem is no longer the face-up plane card. <br>10/1/2009 : Agyrem's first ability will return a card to the battlefield only if it's still in the graveyard by the time the delayed triggered ability resolves. Similarly, Agyrem's second ability will return a card to its owner's hand only if it's still in the graveyard by the time the delayed triggered ability resolves. <br>10/1/2009 : If a creature is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, its last existence on the battlefield is checked to determine its color. <br>10/1/2009 : A creature that caused either of Agyrem's first two abilities to trigger will be returned at the beginning of the next end step even if it's not a creature card. (For example, if it's a Treetop Village.) <br>10/1/2009 : If a token creature is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, one of Agyrem's first two abilities will trigger, but the token will cease to exist long before it would be returned somewhere. <br>10/1/2009 : If multiple creatures are put into their owners' graveyards at the same time (due to combat damage or Planar Cleansing, for example), Agyrem's first two abilities trigger that many times. At the beginning of the next end step, the player whose turn it is at that time puts all of his or her Agyrem delayed triggered abilities on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last ability put on the stack is the first one that resolves.

Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully. <br>10/1/2009 : If you declare exactly one creature as an attacker, each exalted ability on each permanent you control (including, perhaps, the attacking creature itself) will trigger. Note that if a creature has multiple instances of exalted, each one triggers separately. The bonuses are given to the attacking creature, not to the permanent with exalted. Ultimately, the attacking creature will wind up with +1/+1 for each of your exalted abilities. <br>10/1/2009 : If you attack with multiple creatures, but then all but one are removed from combat, your exalted abilities won't trigger. <br>10/1/2009 : Exalted abilities will resolve before blockers are declared. <br>10/1/2009 : Some effects put creatures onto the battlefield attacking. Since those creatures were never declared as attackers, they're ignored by exalted abilities. They won't cause exalted abilities to trigger. If any exalted abilities have already triggered (because exactly one creature was declared as an attacker), those abilities will resolve as normal even though there may now be multiple attackers. <br>10/1/2009 : Exalted bonuses last until the turn ends. If an effect creates an additional combat phase during your turn, a creature that attacked alone during the first combat phase will still have its exalted bonuses in that new phase. If a creature attacks alone during the second combat phase, all your exalted abilities will trigger again. <br>10/1/2009 : In a Two-Headed Giant game, a creature "attacks alone" if it's the only creature declared as an attacker by your entire team. If you control that attacking creature, your exalted abilities will trigger but your teammate's exalted abilities won't. <br>10/1/2009 : A creature with a divinity counter put on it due to the {C} ability remains indestructible even after Bant stops being the face-up plane card. <br>10/1/2009 : If all divinity counters on a creature are moved to a different creature, the indestructibility doesn't move along with them. The first creature is no longer indestructible because it no longer has a divinity counter on it. The second creature isn't indestructible because the {C} ability didn't target it.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[198077]]></id><name><![CDATA[Cliffside Market]]></name><set><![CDATA[PCP]]></set><type><![CDATA[Plane — Mercadia]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[0]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[When you planeswalk to Cliffside Market or at the beginning of your upkeep, you may exchange life totals with target player.<br>Whenever you roll {C}, exchange control of two target permanents that share a card type.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[]]></flavor><artist><![CDATA[Matt Stewart]]></artist><number><![CDATA[5]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[<br>10/1/2009 : A plane card is treated as if its text box included "When you roll {PW}, put this card on the bottom of its owner's planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar deck off that planar deck and turn it face up."

Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully. <br>10/1/2009 : For two players to exchange life totals, what actually happens is that each player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other player's previous life total. For example, if Player A has 5 life and Player B has 3 life before the exchange, Player A will lose 2 life and Player B will gain 2 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly. <br>10/1/2009 : Neither permanent you target with the {C} ability needs to be controlled by you. <br>10/1/2009 : The control-change effect has no duration. For each permanent, it will last until the game ends or the permanent leaves the battlefield. It will override all previous control-change effects for those permanents, and may be overridden by a later control-change effect. <br>10/1/2009 : Both permanents targeted by the {C} ability may be controlled by the same player. If they are, the effect nothing. <br>10/1/2009 : If either permanent targeted by the {C} ability is an illegal target by the time the ability resolves, the exchange doesn't happen.

For example, if a player casts Naturalize ("Destroy target artifact or enchantment") targeting an artifact, Glimmervoid Basin's first ability will copy it for each artifact and enchantment it could target (and each copy will target a different one of those), not just for each artifact it could target. <br>10/1/2009 : Anything that couldn't be targeted by the original spell (due to shroud, protection abilities, targeting restrictions, or any other reason) is just ignored by Glimmervoid Basin's first ability. <br>10/1/2009 : The controller of the spell that caused Glimmervoid Basin's first ability to trigger also controls all the copies. That player chooses the order the copies are put onto the stack. The original spell will be on the stack beneath those copies and resolves last. <br>10/1/2009 : The copies that Glimmervoid Basin's first ability creates are created on the stack, so they're not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (like Glimmervoid Basin's first ability itself) won't trigger. <br>10/1/2009 : If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one --" or the like), the copy will have the same mode.

However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. <br>10/1/2009 : As a token is created by the {C} ability, it checks the printed values of the creature it's copying, as well as any copy effects that have been applied to it.

Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully. <br>10/1/2009 : Despite the appearance of the reminder text, the unearth abilities that Grixis grants are activated abilities of each individual blue, black, and/or red creature card in a graveyard. They're not activated abilities of Grixis. <br>10/1/2009 : A card's mana cost includes its color. <br>10/1/2009 : Grixis may cause a creature card in a graveyard to have multiple unearth abilities. Its owner may activate any one of those abilities. <br>10/1/2009 : If you activate a creature card's unearth ability but that card is removed from your graveyard before the ability resolves, that unearth ability will resolve and do nothing. <br>10/1/2009 : Activating a creature card's unearth ability isn't the same as casting the creature card. The unearth ability is put on the stack, but the creature card is not. Spells and abilities that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle) will interact with unearth, but spells and abilities that interact with spells (such as Essence Scatter) will not. <br>10/1/2009 : At the beginning of the end step, a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability, and it can be countered by effects such as Stifle or Voidslime that counter triggered abilities. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the ability won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature if it would eventually leave the battlefield. <br>10/1/2009 : Unearth grants haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the exile abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of the end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead. <br>10/1/2009 : If a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead -- unless the spell or ability that's causing the creature to leave the battlefield is actually trying to exile it! In that case, it succeeds at exiling it. If it later returns the creature card to the battlefield (as Oblivion Ring or Flickerwisp might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new permanent with no relation to its previous existence. The unearth effect will no longer apply to it. <br>10/1/2009 : Unlike the unearth ability, the {C} ability returns a creature card from a graveyard to the battlefield indefinitely.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[198084]]></id><name><![CDATA[Immersturm]]></name><set><![CDATA[PCP]]></set><type><![CDATA[Plane — Valla]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[0]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, that creature's controller may have it deal damage equal to its power to target creature or player of his or her choice.<br>Whenever you roll {C}, exile target creature, then return it to the battlefield under its owner's control.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[]]></flavor><artist><![CDATA[Raymond Swanland]]></artist><number><![CDATA[17]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[<br>10/1/2009 : A plane card is treated as if its text box included "When you roll {PW}, put this card on the bottom of its owner's planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar deck off that planar deck and turn it face up."

That means that if multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, that player controls all of Immersturm's triggered abilities and may put them on the stack in whichever order he or she likes. The last one put on the stack is the first one to resolve. <br>10/1/2009 : When the {C} ability resolves, the targeted creature is exiled, then immediately returned to the battlefield as a new permanent with no relation to its previous existence. <br>10/1/2009 : Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" choices for the card returned by the {C} ability are made by that card's owner, not its old controller or the controller of the {C} ability. <br>10/1/2009 : A token that has left the battlefield can't come back onto the battlefield.

It won't copy counters on the creature, nor will it copy other effects that have changed the creature's power, toughness, types, color, and so on. <br>10/1/2009 : If the creature that caused Isle of Vesuva's first ability to trigger has already left the battlefield by the time the ability resolves, the ability still creates a token. It will have the copiable values of the characteristics of that nontoken creature as it last existed on the battlefield. <br>10/1/2009 : The {C} ability will destroy all creatures with the same name as the target creature, not just tokens created by Isle of Vesuva's first ability. It doesn't matter who controls them. <br>10/1/2009 : If the permanent targeted by the {C} ability has become an illegal target by the time the ability resolves, the ability is countered. Nothing will be destroyed. <br>10/1/2009 : If the permanent targeted by the {C} ability isn't destroyed (because it regenerates, or because it's indestructible), all other permanents with the same name as it will still be destroyed. <br>10/1/2009 : A token's name is the same as the creature types listed by the effect that created it, unless the token copies a permanent or that effect specifically gives that token a name.

The copy resolves before the original spell. <br>10/1/2009 : A copy is created even if the spell that caused Izzet Steam Maze's first ability to trigger has been countered by the time that ability resolves. <br>10/1/2009 : The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless its controller chooses new ones. That player may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them.

This is called the "planeswalking ability." <br>10/1/2009 : A face-up plane card that's turned face down becomes a new object with no relation to its previous existence. In particular, it loses all counters it may have had. <br>10/1/2009 : The controller of a face-up plane card is the player designated as the "planar controller." Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn't leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until he or she leaves the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first. <br>10/1/2009 : If an ability of a plane refers to "you," it's referring to whoever the plane's controller is at the time, not to the player that started the game with that plane card in his or her deck. Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully. <br>10/1/2009 : If you use a card's flashback ability, you're actually casting that card. It moves from your graveyard to the stack. Abilities that trigger when you cast a spell will trigger. That spell can be countered. <br>10/1/2009 : If you cast a card by using flashback, you cast that card from your graveyard rather than your hand, and you pay an alternative cost rather than its mana cost, but everything else about casting that spell works normally. You must follow timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery), as well as other restrictions (such as "Cast [this card] only before blockers are declared"). You may pay additional costs (such as kicker). Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will apply. <br>10/1/2009 : As a spell cast with flashback resolves, it never goes to its owner's graveyard, so abilities that trigger on cards being put in a graveyard won't trigger. The card is exiled instead. <br>10/1/2009 : If a spell cast by using flashback is countered, it's still exiled rather than being put into its owner's graveyard. <br>10/1/2009 : If you use the flashback ability granted by Otaria to cast a split card from your graveyard, the flashback cost you pay is equal to the mana cost of the half that you're casting. <br>10/1/2009 : If you use the flashback ability granted by Otaria to cast a card with X in its mana cost from your graveyard, you choose the value of X as you cast it. You'll still have to pay that X. <br>10/1/2009 : Otaria may cause an instant or sorcery card in a graveyard to have multiple flashback abilities. Its owner may cast it using any one of those abilities. <br>10/1/2009 : If you roll {C} multiple times in the same turn, you'll take that many extra turns after this one.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[198064]]></id><name><![CDATA[Panopticon]]></name><set><![CDATA[PCP]]></set><type><![CDATA[Plane — Mirrodin]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[0]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[When you planeswalk to Panopticon, draw a card.<br>At the beginning of your draw step, draw an additional card.<br>Whenever you roll {C}, draw a card.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[]]></flavor><artist><![CDATA[John Avon]]></artist><number><![CDATA[29]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[<br>10/1/2009 : A plane card is treated as if its text box included "When you roll {PW}, put this card on the bottom of its owner's planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar deck off that planar deck and turn it face up."

Notably, it doubles the damage from its own {C} ability. <br>10/1/2009 : If multiple effects modify how damage will be dealt, the player who would be dealt damage or the controller of the creature that would be dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, Mending Hands says, "Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to target creature or player this turn." Suppose a spell would deal 5 damage to a player who has cast Mending Hands targeting him or herself. The player who would be dealt damage can either (a) prevent 4 damage first and then let Stronghold Furnace's effect double the remaining 1 damage, taking 2 damage, or (b) double the damage to 10 and then prevent 4 damage, taking 6 damage. <br>10/1/2009 : Combat damage that a source would deal to a planeswalker is not doubled. However, if a source a player controls would deal noncombat damage to an opponent who controls a planeswalker, and that opponent chooses to apply Stronghold Furnace's replacement effect before applying the planeswalker redirection effect, the damage will be doubled before the source's controller chooses whether to deal it to a planeswalker that opponent controls. (If players always apply the planeswalker redirection effect first, Stronghold Furnace's effect will never double damage that a source would deal to a planeswalker.) <br>10/1/2009 : If a spell or ability divides damage among multiple recipients (such as Pyrotechnics does), the damage is divided before Stronghold Furnace's effect doubles it.
