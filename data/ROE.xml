If the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, you must remove all damage from it and destroy the Aura that has totem armor instead. <br>6/15/2010 :  Totem armor's effect is applied no matter why the enchanted permanent would be destroyed: because it's been dealt lethal damage, or because it's being affected by an effect that says to "destroy" it (such as Doom Blade). In either case, all damage is removed from the permanent and the Aura is destroyed instead. <br>6/15/2010 : Totem armor has no effect if the enchanted permanent is put into a graveyard for any other reason, such as if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary permanent with the same name is on the battlefield, or if its toughness is 0 or less. <br>6/15/2010 : If a permanent you control is enchanted with multiple Auras that have totem armor, and the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, one of those Auras is destroyed instead -- but only one of them. You choose which one because you control the enchanted permanent. <br>6/15/2010 : If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor is indestructible, lethal damage and effects that try to destroy it simply have no effect. Totem armor won't do anything because it won't have to. <br>6/15/2010 : If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor would be destroyed by multiple state-based actions at the same time the totem armor's effect will replace all of them and save the creature. <br>6/15/2010 : If a spell or ability (such as Planar Cleansing) would destroy both an Aura with totem armor and the permanent it's enchanting at the same time, totem armor's effect will save the enchanted permanent from being destroyed. Instead, the spell or ability will destroy the Aura in two different ways at the same time, but the result is the same as destroying it once. <br>6/15/2010 : Totem armor's effect is not regeneration. Specifically, if totem armor's effect is applied, the enchanted permanent does not become tapped and is not removed from combat as a result. Effects that say the enchanted permanent can't be regenerated (as Vendetta does) won't prevent totem armor's effect from being applied. <br>6/15/2010 : Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and the enchanted permanent has gained a regeneration shield. The next time it would be destroyed, you choose whether to apply the regeneration effect or the totem armor effect. The other effect is unused and remains, in case the permanent would be destroyed again. <br>6/15/2010 : Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and that Aura has gained a regeneration shield. The next time the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, the Aura would be destroyed instead -- but it regenerates, so nothing is destroyed at all. Alternately, if that Aura somehow becomes indestructible, the enchanted permanent is effectively indestructible as well. <br>6/15/2010 : If a spell or ability says that it would "destroy" a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, that spell or ability causes the Aura to be destroyed instead. (This matters for cards such as Karmic Justice.) Totem armor doesn't destroy the Aura; rather, it changes the effects of the spell or ability. On the other hand, if a spell or ability deals lethal damage to a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, the game rules regarding lethal damage cause the Aura to be destroyed, not that spell or ability. <br>6/15/2010 : When the enchanted creature attacks, all lands controlled by that creature's controller (who is not necessarily the Aura's controller) untap.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[193638]]></id><name><![CDATA[Beastbreaker of Bala Ged]]></name><set><![CDATA[ROE]]></set><type><![CDATA[Creature — Human Warrior]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[U]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{1}{G}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[2]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[2]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[2]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Level up {2}{G} ({2}{G}: Put a level counter on this.

In particular, they don't overwrite the creature's level up ability; it always has that. <br>6/15/2010 : Effects that set a leveler's power or toughness to a specific value, including the effects from a level symbol's ability, apply in timestamp order. The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it. <br>6/15/2010 : Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. <br>6/15/2010 : If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities -- including those represented by level symbols -- are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy. <br>6/15/2010 : A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved.

On the other hand, if a spell or ability deals lethal damage to a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, the game rules regarding lethal damage cause the Aura to be destroyed, not that spell or ability.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[193465]]></id><name><![CDATA[Bramblesnap]]></name><set><![CDATA[ROE]]></set><type><![CDATA[Creature — Elemental]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[U]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{1}{G}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[2]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[1]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[1]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Trample<br>Tap an untapped creature you control: Bramblesnap gets +1/+1 until end of turn.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[A bramblesnap is formed by grafting together thirteen different plants that already hunger for meat.]]></flavor><artist><![CDATA[James Ryman]]></artist><number><![CDATA[180]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[<br>6/15/2010 : Since Bramblesnap's activated ability doesn't have a tap symbol in its cost, you can tap a creature (including Bramblesnap itself) that hasn't been under your control since your most recent turn began to pay the cost.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[193442]]></id><name><![CDATA[Brimstone Mage]]></name><set><![CDATA[ROE]]></set><type><![CDATA[Creature — Human Shaman]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[U]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{2}{R}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[3]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[2]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[2]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Level up {3}{R} ({3}{R}: Put a level counter on this.

The spell is simply put into your graveyard. You won't get to cast it again next turn. <br>6/15/2010 : If you cast a spell with rebound from anywhere other than your hand (such as from your graveyard due to Sins of the Past, from your library due to cascade, or from your opponent's hand due to Sen Triplets), rebound won't have any effect. If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel). <br>6/15/2010 : If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves. <br>6/15/2010 : Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand. <br>6/15/2010 : If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard. Rather, it's exiled directly from the stack. Effects that care about cards being put into your graveyard won't do anything. <br>6/15/2010 : At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law). <br>6/15/2010 : If you are unable to cast a card from exile this way, or you choose not to, nothing happens when the delayed triggered ability resolves. The card remains exiled for the rest of the game, and you won't get another chance to cast the card. The same is true if the ability is countered (due to Stifle, perhaps). <br>6/15/2010 : If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to your graveyard when it resolves or is countered. It won't go back to exile. <br>6/15/2010 : Multiple instances of rebound on the same spell are redundant. <br>6/15/2010 : The rebound effect is not optional. Each instant and sorcery spell you cast from your hand is exiled instead of being put into your graveyard as it resolves, whether you want it to be or not. Casting the spell during your next upkeep is optional, however. <br>6/15/2010 : If a spell moves itself into another zone as part of its resolution (as Arc Blade, All Suns' Dawn, and Beacon of Unrest do), rebound won't get a chance to apply. <br>6/15/2010 : If a spell you cast from your hand has both rebound and buyback (and the buyback cost was paid), you choose which effect to apply as it resolves. <br>6/15/2010 : You'll be able to cast a spell with flashback three times this way. First you can cast it from your hand. It will be exiled due to rebound as it resolves. Then you can cast it from exile due to rebound's delayed triggered ability. It will be put into your graveyard as it resolves. Then you can cast it from your graveyard due to flashback. It will be exiled due to flashback as it resolves. <br>6/15/2010 : For the rebound effect to happen, Cast Through Time needs to be on the battlefield as the spell _finishes_ resolving. For example, if you cast Warp World from your hand, and as part of its resolution it puts Cast Through Time onto the battlefield, Warp World will rebound. Conversely, if Warp World shuffles your Cast Through Time into your library as part of its resolution, and doesn't put another one onto the battlefield, it will not rebound. <br>6/15/2010 : If you cast an instant or sorcery spell from your hand and it's exiled due to rebound, the delayed triggered ability will allow you to cast it during your next upkeep even if Cast Through Time has left the battlefield by then. <br>6/15/2010 : If you cast a card from exile "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. Any X in the mana cost will be 0. On the other hand, if the card has optional additional costs (such as kicker or multikicker), you may pay those when you cast the card. If the card has mandatory additional costs (such as Momentous Fall does), you must pay those if you choose to cast the card. <br>6/15/2010 : If a spell has restrictions on when it can be cast (for example, "Cast [this spell] only during the declare blockers step"), those restrictions may prevent you from casting it from exile during your upkeep. <br>6/15/2010 : If you cast a spell using the madness or suspend abilities, you're casting it from exile, not from your hand. Although those spells will have rebound, the ability won't have any effect. <br>6/15/2010 : Similarly, if you gain control of an instant or sorcery spell with Commandeer, it will have rebound, but the ability won't do anything because that spell wasn't cast from your hand.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[193440]]></id><name><![CDATA[Champion's Drake]]></name><set><![CDATA[ROE]]></set><type><![CDATA[Creature — Drake]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{1}{U}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[2]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[1]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[1]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Flying<br>Champion's Drake gets +3/+3 as long as you control a creature with three or more level counters on it.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA["'Fraid of heights?

If the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, you must remove all damage from it and destroy the Aura that has totem armor instead. <br>6/15/2010 :  Totem armor's effect is applied no matter why the enchanted permanent would be destroyed: because it's been dealt lethal damage, or because it's being affected by an effect that says to "destroy" it (such as Doom Blade). In either case, all damage is removed from the permanent and the Aura is destroyed instead. <br>6/15/2010 : Totem armor has no effect if the enchanted permanent is put into a graveyard for any other reason, such as if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary permanent with the same name is on the battlefield, or if its toughness is 0 or less. <br>6/15/2010 : If a permanent you control is enchanted with multiple Auras that have totem armor, and the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, one of those Auras is destroyed instead -- but only one of them. You choose which one because you control the enchanted permanent. <br>6/15/2010 : If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor is indestructible, lethal damage and effects that try to destroy it simply have no effect. Totem armor won't do anything because it won't have to. <br>6/15/2010 : If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor would be destroyed by multiple state-based actions at the same time the totem armor's effect will replace all of them and save the creature. <br>6/15/2010 : If a spell or ability (such as Planar Cleansing) would destroy both an Aura with totem armor and the permanent it's enchanting at the same time, totem armor's effect will save the enchanted permanent from being destroyed. Instead, the spell or ability will destroy the Aura in two different ways at the same time, but the result is the same as destroying it once. <br>6/15/2010 : Totem armor's effect is not regeneration. Specifically, if totem armor's effect is applied, the enchanted permanent does not become tapped and is not removed from combat as a result. Effects that say the enchanted permanent can't be regenerated (as Vendetta does) won't prevent totem armor's effect from being applied. <br>6/15/2010 : Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and the enchanted permanent has gained a regeneration shield.

If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel). <br>6/15/2010 : If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves. <br>6/15/2010 : Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand. <br>6/15/2010 : If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard.

Instead, the spell or ability will destroy the Aura in two different ways at the same time, but the result is the same as destroying it once. <br>6/15/2010 : Totem armor's effect is not regeneration. Specifically, if totem armor's effect is applied, the enchanted permanent does not become tapped and is not removed from combat as a result. Effects that say the enchanted permanent can't be regenerated (as Vendetta does) won't prevent totem armor's effect from being applied. <br>6/15/2010 : Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and the enchanted permanent has gained a regeneration shield.

The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it. <br>6/15/2010 : Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. <br>6/15/2010 : If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities -- including those represented by level symbols -- are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy. <br>6/15/2010 : A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly. <br>6/15/2010 : Echo Mage's last two activated abilities can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it. <br>6/15/2010 : When either ability resolves, it creates a copy (or two) of a spell. The copies are created on the stack, so they're not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. Each copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities. Each copy resolves before the original spell does. <br>6/15/2010 : Each copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal). <br>6/15/2010 : If you activate Echo Mage's last ability to copy a spell twice, you may choose new targets for each copy independently. They don't have to have the same targets as one another.

If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel). <br>6/15/2010 : If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves. <br>6/15/2010 : Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand. <br>6/15/2010 : If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard. Rather, it's exiled directly from the stack. Effects that care about cards being put into your graveyard won't do anything. <br>6/15/2010 : At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored.

The card remains exiled for the rest of the game, and you won't get another chance to cast the card. The same is true if the ability is countered (due to Stifle, perhaps). <br>6/15/2010 : If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to your graveyard when it resolves or is countered.

Those spells will resolve, but the part of their effect that would counter Emrakul won't do anything. Any other effects those spells have will work as normal. <br>6/15/2010 : "Protection from colored spells" means that Emrakul can't be the target of colored spells (including colored Aura spells) or of abilities whose sources are colored spells (such as the "when you cast" ability of an Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre that's been turned red by Painter's Servant). It also means that all damage that would be dealt to Emrakul by colored spells is prevented. Like every protection ability, it works only while Emrakul is on the battlefield. <br>6/15/2010 : "Colored spells" is not synonymous with "colored instants and sorceries." For example, if a player cycles Choking Tethers, its triggered ability may target Emrakul because Choking Tethers wasn't cast as a spell. <br>6/15/2010 : Emrakul may be affected by colored spells that don't target it or deal damage to it, including those that cause it to become blocked. Abilities of colored permanents (such as Journey to Nowhere) may target it.

That's because the effect states a true thing about a set of creatures, but doesn't actually change the characteristics of those creatures. As a result, whatever creatures the targeted opponent controls during the declare attackers step of his or her next turn must attack Gideon Jura if able. This includes creatures that come under that player's control after the ability has resolved and creatures that have lost all abilities. <br>6/15/2010 : Gideon Jura's first ability causes creatures to attack him if able. If, during the affected player's declare attackers step, a creature he or she controls is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or is affected by "summoning sickness," then that creature doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so the creature doesn't have to attack in that case either. <br>6/15/2010 : If a creature controlled by the affected player can't attack Gideon Jura (because he's no longer on the battlefield, for example), that player may have it attack you, another one of your planeswalkers, or nothing at all. <br>6/15/2010 : Gideon Jura's first ability applies during each combat phase of the affected player's next turn (as opposed to applying during the affected player's next combat phase). The distinction is relevant if there are no combat phases during that turn (due to Fatespinner's effect, for example) or there are multiples (due to World at War, for example). <br>6/15/2010 : If Gideon Jura becomes a creature due to his third ability, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. Gideon Jura was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger. <br>6/15/2010 : If Gideon Jura becomes a creature, he may be affected by "summoning sickness." You can't attack with him or use any of his {T} abilities (if he gains any) unless he began your most recent turn on the battlefield under your control. Note that summoning sickness cares about when Gideon Jura came under your control, not when he became a creature. <br>6/15/2010 : Gideon Jura's third ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: Gideon is just a planeswalker type (not a creature type), and Human and Soldier are just creature types (not planeswalker types). <br>6/15/2010 : If you activate Gideon Jura's third ability and then unpreventable damage is dealt to him (due to Unstable Footing, for example), that damage has all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon Jura (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). If the total amount of damage marked on Gideon Jura is lethal damage, he's destroyed as a state-based action. If Gideon Jura has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard as a state-based action. <br>6/15/2010 : If you activate Gideon Jura's third ability and then a creature enters the battlefield as a copy of him, that copy will be just a planeswalker, not a creature. (The effect of Gideon's third ability isn't copied, just as the effect of a Giant Growth, for example, wouldn't be copied.) Since both permanents will be planeswalkers with the planeswalker type Gideon, each one will be put into his owner's graveyard as a state-based action due to the "planeswalker uniqueness rule." <br>6/15/2010 : If you activate Gideon Jura's third ability and then a permanent that's already on the battlefield becomes a copy of him, that copy will be just a planeswalker, not a creature. If the original Gideon Jura is still on the battlefield by the time the copy effect happens, each of those permanents will be put into his owner's graveyard as a state-based action due to the "planeswalker uniqueness rule." If the original Gideon Jura is gone by this time, the other permanent will be put into his owner's graveyard as a state-based action for having no loyalty counters on him (unless, for some odd reason, he already had loyalty counters on him). <br>6/15/2010 : Say you activate Gideon Jura's third ability, then an opponent gains control of him before combat. You may have any of your creatures attack Gideon Jura (since he's still a planeswalker). Then Gideon Jura may block (since he's a creature). He may block any eligible attacking creature, including one that's attacking him! During combat, he behaves as an attacked planeswalker and/or a blocking creature, as appropriate. For example, he deals combat damage to any creatures he's blocking, but he doesn't deal combat damage to any unblocked creatures that are attacking him. <br>1/22/2011 : The first ability only affects the declaration of attackers. If a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking (thanks to Hero of Bladehold, Preeminent Captain, or the Ninjutsu ability, for example), that creature's controller may choose the defending player or planeswalker that it will be attacking in the normal way.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[198172]]></id><name><![CDATA[Gigantomancer]]></name><set><![CDATA[ROE]]></set><type><![CDATA[Creature — Human Shaman]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[R]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{7}{G}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[8]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[1]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[1]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[{1}: Target creature you control becomes 7/7 until end of turn.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA["All life is driven by an indomitable will to survive.

The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it. <br>6/15/2010 : Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect.

The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy. <br>6/15/2010 : A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved.

They prevent damage of any kind, not just combat damage. <br>6/15/2010 : Remember that Hedron-Field Purists never has both of these prevention effects at the same time. <br>6/15/2010 : If a source would deal damage to multiple applicable recipients, the prevention effects apply to each of those recipients separately. For example, if Hedron-Field Purists is level 1 and you cast Earthquake ("Earthquake deals X damage to each creature without flying and each player") with X equal to 3, that Earthquake will deal 2 damage to you, 2 damage to each creature without flying you control, 3 damage to each other player, and 3 damage to each creature without flying other players control. <br>6/15/2010 : The prevention effects don't affect damage dealt directly to a planeswalker you control (such as combat damage, or damage Sarkhan the Mad deals to himself due to his first ability). They can prevent noncombat damage that's redirected from you to a planeswalker you control if you apply these effects first. <br>6/15/2010 : The effects from multiple Hedron-Field Purists are cumulative.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[193656]]></id><name><![CDATA[Hellcarver Demon]]></name><set><![CDATA[ROE]]></set><type><![CDATA[Creature — Demon]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[M]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{3}{B}{B}{B}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[6]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[6]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[6]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Flying<br>Whenever Hellcarver Demon deals combat damage to a player, sacrifice all other permanents you control and discard your hand.

You may cast those cards in any order. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (such as creature or sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as "Cast [this card] only before the combat damage step").

If the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, you must remove all damage from it and destroy the Aura that has totem armor instead. <br>6/15/2010 :  Totem armor's effect is applied no matter why the enchanted permanent would be destroyed: because it's been dealt lethal damage, or because it's being affected by an effect that says to "destroy" it (such as Doom Blade). In either case, all damage is removed from the permanent and the Aura is destroyed instead. <br>6/15/2010 : Totem armor has no effect if the enchanted permanent is put into a graveyard for any other reason, such as if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary permanent with the same name is on the battlefield, or if its toughness is 0 or less. <br>6/15/2010 : If a permanent you control is enchanted with multiple Auras that have totem armor, and the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, one of those Auras is destroyed instead -- but only one of them. You choose which one because you control the enchanted permanent. <br>6/15/2010 : If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor is indestructible, lethal damage and effects that try to destroy it simply have no effect. Totem armor won't do anything because it won't have to. <br>6/15/2010 : If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor would be destroyed by multiple state-based actions at the same time the totem armor's effect will replace all of them and save the creature. <br>6/15/2010 : If a spell or ability (such as Planar Cleansing) would destroy both an Aura with totem armor and the permanent it's enchanting at the same time, totem armor's effect will save the enchanted permanent from being destroyed. Instead, the spell or ability will destroy the Aura in two different ways at the same time, but the result is the same as destroying it once. <br>6/15/2010 : Totem armor's effect is not regeneration. Specifically, if totem armor's effect is applied, the enchanted permanent does not become tapped and is not removed from combat as a result. Effects that say the enchanted permanent can't be regenerated (as Vendetta does) won't prevent totem armor's effect from being applied. <br>6/15/2010 : Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and the enchanted permanent has gained a regeneration shield. The next time it would be destroyed, you choose whether to apply the regeneration effect or the totem armor effect. The other effect is unused and remains, in case the permanent would be destroyed again. <br>6/15/2010 : Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and that Aura has gained a regeneration shield. The next time the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, the Aura would be destroyed instead -- but it regenerates, so nothing is destroyed at all. Alternately, if that Aura somehow becomes indestructible, the enchanted permanent is effectively indestructible as well. <br>6/15/2010 : If a spell or ability says that it would "destroy" a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, that spell or ability causes the Aura to be destroyed instead. (This matters for cards such as Karmic Justice.) Totem armor doesn't destroy the Aura; rather, it changes the effects of the spell or ability. On the other hand, if a spell or ability deals lethal damage to a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, the game rules regarding lethal damage cause the Aura to be destroyed, not that spell or ability.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[198176]]></id><name><![CDATA[Ikiral Outrider]]></name><set><![CDATA[ROE]]></set><type><![CDATA[Creature — Human Soldier]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{1}{W}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[2]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[1]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[2]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Level up {4} ({4}: Put a level counter on this.

The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it. <br>6/15/2010 : Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. <br>6/15/2010 : If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities -- including those represented by level symbols -- are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy. <br>6/15/2010 : A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly. <br>6/15/2010 : In a two-player game, if you have a level 7 Lighthouse Chronologist and there are no other extra-turn effects, the game will proceed like this (with extra turns in brackets): your turn, your opponent's turn, [your turn], your turn, your opponent's turn, [your turn], your turn, your opponent's turn, and so on. <br>6/15/2010 : In a four-player game, if you have a level 7 Lighthouse Chronologist and there are no other extra-turn effects, the game will proceed like this (with extra turns in brackets): your turn, opponent A's turn, [your turn], opponent B's turn, [your turn], opponent C's turn, [your turn], your turn, opponent A's turn, and so on. The same principle applies to a multiplayer game with a different number of players. <br>6/15/2010 : The effects of multiple level 7 Lighthouse Chronologists are cumulative. If you control two of them in a two-player game, you'll take three turns for each turn your opponent takes. <br>6/15/2010 : In a two-player game, if you and your opponent each control a level 7 Lighthouse Chronologist, they'll essentially cancel each other out and you'll alternate turns. Since all the turns you'd be taking are extra turns created by these abilities, make sure you know whose normal turn is supposed to be next in case one or both of the Lighthouse Chronologists leaves the battlefield. <br>6/15/2010 : In a multiplayer game, if multiple players each control a level 7 Lighthouse Chronologist, extra turns may sometimes be created faster than they can be taken. Keep track of them carefully. If multiple Chronologist's abilities trigger during the same turn, the player whose turn would show up sooner in the natural turn order will get the first extra turn. For example, say Players B and C each control a level 7 Lighthouse Chronologist. Player A takes a turn. The game will proceed like this (with extra turns in brackets): Player A's current turn, [Player B's turn], [Player C's turn], [Player B's turn], [Player C's turn], and so on. Because Players B and C will each add another extra turn after the other player's extra turn, Player A will not take another turn as long as both level 7 Lighthouse Chronologists remain on the battlefield.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[193463]]></id><name><![CDATA[Lightmine Field]]></name><set><![CDATA[ROE]]></set><type><![CDATA[Enchantment]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[R]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{2}{W}{W}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[4]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Whenever one or more creatures attack, Lightmine Field deals damage to each of those creatures equal to the number of attacking creatures.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[If you want to kill a lot of goblins, just make sure your defenses look like fun.]]></flavor><artist><![CDATA[Eric Deschamps]]></artist><number><![CDATA[32]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[<br>6/15/2010 : Lightmine Field's ability triggers when any creatures attack, including your own. <br>6/15/2010 : Which creatures are dealt damage is based on which creatures were declared as attackers during the declare attackers step. <br>6/15/2010 : How much damage each of those creatures is dealt is based how many creatures are attacking at the time the ability resolves. <br>6/15/2010 : For example: If a creature attacks but is removed from combat before Lightmine Field's ability resolves (because it would be destroyed and regenerates, perhaps), that creature is dealt damage by Lightmine Field but isn't counted when determining the amount of damage.

If the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, you must remove all damage from it and destroy the Aura that has totem armor instead. <br>6/15/2010 :  Totem armor's effect is applied no matter why the enchanted permanent would be destroyed: because it's been dealt lethal damage, or because it's being affected by an effect that says to "destroy" it (such as Doom Blade). In either case, all damage is removed from the permanent and the Aura is destroyed instead. <br>6/15/2010 : Totem armor has no effect if the enchanted permanent is put into a graveyard for any other reason, such as if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary permanent with the same name is on the battlefield, or if its toughness is 0 or less. <br>6/15/2010 : If a permanent you control is enchanted with multiple Auras that have totem armor, and the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, one of those Auras is destroyed instead -- but only one of them. You choose which one because you control the enchanted permanent. <br>6/15/2010 : If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor is indestructible, lethal damage and effects that try to destroy it simply have no effect. Totem armor won't do anything because it won't have to. <br>6/15/2010 : If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor would be destroyed by multiple state-based actions at the same time the totem armor's effect will replace all of them and save the creature. <br>6/15/2010 : If a spell or ability (such as Planar Cleansing) would destroy both an Aura with totem armor and the permanent it's enchanting at the same time, totem armor's effect will save the enchanted permanent from being destroyed. Instead, the spell or ability will destroy the Aura in two different ways at the same time, but the result is the same as destroying it once. <br>6/15/2010 : Totem armor's effect is not regeneration. Specifically, if totem armor's effect is applied, the enchanted permanent does not become tapped and is not removed from combat as a result. Effects that say the enchanted permanent can't be regenerated (as Vendetta does) won't prevent totem armor's effect from being applied. <br>6/15/2010 : Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and the enchanted permanent has gained a regeneration shield. The next time it would be destroyed, you choose whether to apply the regeneration effect or the totem armor effect. The other effect is unused and remains, in case the permanent would be destroyed again. <br>6/15/2010 : Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and that Aura has gained a regeneration shield. The next time the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, the Aura would be destroyed instead -- but it regenerates, so nothing is destroyed at all. Alternately, if that Aura somehow becomes indestructible, the enchanted permanent is effectively indestructible as well. <br>6/15/2010 : If a spell or ability says that it would "destroy" a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, that spell or ability causes the Aura to be destroyed instead. (This matters for cards such as Karmic Justice.) Totem armor doesn't destroy the Aura; rather, it changes the effects of the spell or ability. On the other hand, if a spell or ability deals lethal damage to a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, the game rules regarding lethal damage cause the Aura to be destroyed, not that spell or ability.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[198173]]></id><name><![CDATA[Merfolk Observer]]></name><set><![CDATA[ROE]]></set><type><![CDATA[Creature — Merfolk Rogue]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{1}{U}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[2]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[2]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[1]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[When Merfolk Observer enters the battlefield, look at the top card of target player's library.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA["The structure gets bigger every hour, with hedrons coalescing even deep under the surface.

In that case, Renegade Doppelganger remains 0/1 and still has its triggered ability. <br>6/15/2010 : If Renegade Doppelganger becomes a copy of another creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. Renegade Doppelganger was already on the battlefield; it only changed its characteristics. If Renegade Doppelganger gains any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities, they won't do anything. The same is true of any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities. <br>6/15/2010 : If Renegade Doppelganger becomes a copy of another creature, it copies exactly what was printed on that card and nothing more (unless that card is copying something else or it's a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether the original creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or whether it's been affected by any noncopy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on. <br>6/15/2010 : If Renegade Doppelganger becomes a copy of a creature that is itself copying something else (for example, if the creature that entered the battlefield is a Clone), then Renegade Doppelganger becomes a copy of whatever that creature is copying. <br>6/15/2010 : If Renegade Doppelganger becomes a copy of a token, Renegade Doppelganger copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield. Renegade Doppelganger doesn't become a token. <br>6/15/2010 : Noncopy effects that have already applied to Renegade Doppelganger will continue to apply to it after it becomes a copy of something else. For example, if Giant Growth had given it +3/+3 earlier in the turn, then it becomes a copy of Runeclaw Bear (a 2/2 creature), it will be a 5/5 Runeclaw Bear. <br>6/15/2010 : During the cleanup step, Renegade Doppelganger's copy effect wears off. It will go back to being a 0/1 blue creature named Renegade Doppelganger, and will have its original ability again. Note that this happens at the same time that damage marked on the Renegade Doppelganger is removed. If it was dealt damage earlier in the turn, this damage will not cause Renegade Doppelganger to be destroyed when its copy effect wears off. <br>6/15/2010 : If a creature enters the battlefield under your control and Renegade Doppelganger's ability triggers, it can become a copy of that creature when the ability resolves even if that creature has left the battlefield by then. If it has, its last existence on the battlefield is checked to see what it was (specifically, if it was itself or if it was copying something else). <br>6/15/2010 : If Renegade Doppelganger becomes a copy of a legendary creature, both creatures will be put into the graveyard as a state-based action (unless one has left the battlefield before the Doppelganger's ability resolves). <br>6/15/2010 : Renegade Doppelganger's ability isn't targeted. It can copy a creature with shroud or protection. <br>6/15/2010 : If the creature Renegade Doppelganger copies has an ability that triggers at the beginning of the end step, that ability will trigger and resolve before Renegade Doppelganger's copy effect wears off. <br>6/15/2010 : If Renegade Doppelganger becomes a copy of a creature with an ability that causes you to make a choice (such as naming a card or choosing a color) as it enters the battlefield, and another ability that refers to that choice, those abilities of the Doppelganger won't do anything. You won't have the chance to make a choice since the Doppelganger is already on the battlefield, so the value of that choice is undefined. <br>6/15/2010 : If Renegade Doppelganger and another creature enter the battlefield under your control at the same time, Renegade Doppelganger's ability will trigger. When the ability resolves, Renegade Doppelganger can become a copy of that creature. <br>6/15/2010 : If multiple creatures enter the battlefield under your control at the same time, Renegade Doppelganger's ability will trigger once for each of them. You choose the order that those abilities will resolve. It's possible to have Renegade Doppelganger become a copy of something, activate an activated ability of that creature, then have it become a copy of something else under this scenario. The last ability that resolves that you choose to use determines what it ends up a copy of.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[193657]]></id><name><![CDATA[Repay in Kind]]></name><set><![CDATA[ROE]]></set><type><![CDATA[Sorcery]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[R]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{5}{B}{B}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[7]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Each player's life total becomes the lowest life total among all players.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[Sorin has gathered grudges for centuries, patiently awaiting the day he can exact the perfect vengeance.]]></flavor><artist><![CDATA[Vance Kovacs]]></artist><number><![CDATA[125]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[<br>6/15/2010 : For a player's life total to become a certain number that's lower than his or her current life total, what actually happens is that the player loses the appropriate amount of life.

Abilities that interact with life loss will interact with this effect accordingly. <br>6/15/2010 : In a Two-Headed Giant game, anything that cares about a player's life total checks the life total of that player's team. In addition, if an effect would cause the life total of each member of a team to become a certain number, that team chooses one of its members. On that team, only that player is affected, then the life total change is applied to the entire team. (These are changes from previous rules.) For example, if one team has 13 life and another team has 21 life, the team with the higher life total chooses one of its members and Repay in Kind causes that player to lose 8 life, thus causing that team's life total to also be 13.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[194930]]></id><name><![CDATA[Repel the Darkness]]></name><set><![CDATA[ROE]]></set><type><![CDATA[Instant]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{2}{W}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[3]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Tap up to two target creatures.<br>Draw a card.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[A boon to those who cannot see in the dark.

The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it. <br>6/15/2010 : Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. <br>6/15/2010 : If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities -- including those represented by level symbols -- are copied.

The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy. <br>6/15/2010 : A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved.

If the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, you must remove all damage from it and destroy the Aura that has totem armor instead. <br>6/15/2010 :  Totem armor's effect is applied no matter why the enchanted permanent would be destroyed: because it's been dealt lethal damage, or because it's being affected by an effect that says to "destroy" it (such as Doom Blade). In either case, all damage is removed from the permanent and the Aura is destroyed instead. <br>6/15/2010 : Totem armor has no effect if the enchanted permanent is put into a graveyard for any other reason, such as if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary permanent with the same name is on the battlefield, or if its toughness is 0 or less. <br>6/15/2010 : If a permanent you control is enchanted with multiple Auras that have totem armor, and the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, one of those Auras is destroyed instead -- but only one of them. You choose which one because you control the enchanted permanent. <br>6/15/2010 : If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor is indestructible, lethal damage and effects that try to destroy it simply have no effect. Totem armor won't do anything because it won't have to. <br>6/15/2010 : If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor would be destroyed by multiple state-based actions at the same time the totem armor's effect will replace all of them and save the creature. <br>6/15/2010 : If a spell or ability (such as Planar Cleansing) would destroy both an Aura with totem armor and the permanent it's enchanting at the same time, totem armor's effect will save the enchanted permanent from being destroyed. Instead, the spell or ability will destroy the Aura in two different ways at the same time, but the result is the same as destroying it once. <br>6/15/2010 : Totem armor's effect is not regeneration. Specifically, if totem armor's effect is applied, the enchanted permanent does not become tapped and is not removed from combat as a result. Effects that say the enchanted permanent can't be regenerated (as Vendetta does) won't prevent totem armor's effect from being applied. <br>6/15/2010 : Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and the enchanted permanent has gained a regeneration shield. The next time it would be destroyed, you choose whether to apply the regeneration effect or the totem armor effect. The other effect is unused and remains, in case the permanent would be destroyed again. <br>6/15/2010 : Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and that Aura has gained a regeneration shield. The next time the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, the Aura would be destroyed instead -- but it regenerates, so nothing is destroyed at all. Alternately, if that Aura somehow becomes indestructible, the enchanted permanent is effectively indestructible as well. <br>6/15/2010 : If a spell or ability says that it would "destroy" a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, that spell or ability causes the Aura to be destroyed instead. (This matters for cards such as Karmic Justice.) Totem armor doesn't destroy the Aura; rather, it changes the effects of the spell or ability. On the other hand, if a spell or ability deals lethal damage to a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, the game rules regarding lethal damage cause the Aura to be destroyed, not that spell or ability. <br>6/15/2010 : Snake Umbra grants the triggered ability to the creature. It triggers whenever the enchanted creature deals damage to an opponent of its controller (who is not necessarily an opponent of the Aura's controller). In other words, if your Snake Umbra winds up enchanting your opponent's creature, that opponent will draw a card whenever that creature damages you. <br>6/15/2010 : The ability triggers when the enchanted creature deals any damage, not just combat damage.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[193615]]></id><name><![CDATA[Soulbound Guardians]]></name><set><![CDATA[ROE]]></set><type><![CDATA[Creature — Kor Spirit]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[U]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{4}{W}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[5]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[4]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[5]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Defender, flying]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[The kor's most righteous dead are given the greatest reward: an eternity tied to the land they so cherish.]]></flavor><artist><![CDATA[Erica Yang]]></artist><number><![CDATA[45]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[193499]]></id><name><![CDATA[Soul's Attendant]]></name><set><![CDATA[ROE]]></set><type><![CDATA[Creature — Human Cleric]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{W}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[1]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[1]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[1]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Whenever another creature enters the battlefield, you may gain 1 life.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[In truth, her own faith was gone, trodden in Ulamog's wake.

It may be blocked. If it isn't blocked, it simply won't deal combat damage to anything. <br>6/15/2010 : In a Two-Headed Giant game, the controller of an attacking creature with annihilator chooses which of the defending players is affected by the ability. Only that player sacrifices permanents. The choice is made as the ability resolves; once a player is chosen, it's too late for anyone to respond. <br>6/15/2010 : You cast Eldrazi cards from outside the game as part of the resolution of Spawnsire of Ulamog's last ability. You may cast those cards in any order. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (such as creature or sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law). You cast all of the cards you like, putting them onto the stack, then the ability finishes resolving.

The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it. <br>6/15/2010 : Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect.

It also won't affect nonmana parts of an activation cost, if there are any. <br>6/15/2010 : Training Grounds can reduce the part of an activation cost represented by generic mana symbols down to nothing, as long as it still costs at least one mana. For example, if an activation cost is {2}{G}, you'd have to pay only {G}. If an activation cost is {2}, though, you'd still have to pay {1}. <br>6/15/2010 : Training Grounds can reduce the amount you pay for a creature's activated ability cost that includes {X}. For example, Drana, Kalastria Bloodchief has an activated ability that costs {X}{B}{B}. If you control Training Grounds and you activate the ability with X equal to 5, you'll have to pay only {3}{B}{B}. This is true even if the ability states that {X} must be paid with a certain color of mana, as Crimson Hellkite's ability does. <br>6/15/2010 : If an activated ability of a creature you control costs no generic mana to activate (for example, if it costs {R}{R}, it costs {0}, or it costs only nonmana actions such as {T} or "Sacrifice a creature"), Training Grounds simply won't affect it. In particular, it won't increase the cost to include a mana payment of {1}. <br>6/15/2010 : Training Grounds takes the total cost to activate a creature's activated ability into account, not just the cost printed on it. For example, Furnace Spirit has an activated ability that costs {R}, and Suppression Field says "Activated abilities cost {2} more to activate unless they're mana abilities." Since activating Furnace Spirit's activated ability would now cost {2}{R}, Training Grounds reduces that cost back to {R}. <br>6/15/2010 : You may choose not to apply Training Ground's cost reduction effect. You may also choose to apply only part of it (causing an activated ability of a creature you control to cost just {1} less to activate).]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[198177]]></id><name><![CDATA[Traitorous Instinct]]></name><set><![CDATA[ROE]]></set><type><![CDATA[Sorcery]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[U]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{3}{R}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[4]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Gain control of target creature until end of turn.

The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it. <br>6/15/2010 : Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. <br>6/15/2010 : If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities -- including those represented by level symbols -- are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy. <br>6/15/2010 : A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly. <br>6/15/2010 : Lethal damage and effects that say "destroy" won't cause an indestructible creature to be put into the graveyard.

If the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, you must remove all damage from it and destroy the Aura that has totem armor instead. <br>6/15/2010 :  Totem armor's effect is applied no matter why the enchanted permanent would be destroyed: because it's been dealt lethal damage, or because it's being affected by an effect that says to "destroy" it (such as Doom Blade). In either case, all damage is removed from the permanent and the Aura is destroyed instead. <br>6/15/2010 : Totem armor has no effect if the enchanted permanent is put into a graveyard for any other reason, such as if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary permanent with the same name is on the battlefield, or if its toughness is 0 or less. <br>6/15/2010 : If a permanent you control is enchanted with multiple Auras that have totem armor, and the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, one of those Auras is destroyed instead -- but only one of them. You choose which one because you control the enchanted permanent. <br>6/15/2010 : If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor is indestructible, lethal damage and effects that try to destroy it simply have no effect. Totem armor won't do anything because it won't have to. <br>6/15/2010 : If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor would be destroyed by multiple state-based actions at the same time the totem armor's effect will replace all of them and save the creature. <br>6/15/2010 : If a spell or ability (such as Planar Cleansing) would destroy both an Aura with totem armor and the permanent it's enchanting at the same time, totem armor's effect will save the enchanted permanent from being destroyed. Instead, the spell or ability will destroy the Aura in two different ways at the same time, but the result is the same as destroying it once. <br>6/15/2010 : Totem armor's effect is not regeneration. Specifically, if totem armor's effect is applied, the enchanted permanent does not become tapped and is not removed from combat as a result. Effects that say the enchanted permanent can't be regenerated (as Vendetta does) won't prevent totem armor's effect from being applied. <br>6/15/2010 : Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and the enchanted permanent has gained a regeneration shield. The next time it would be destroyed, you choose whether to apply the regeneration effect or the totem armor effect. The other effect is unused and remains, in case the permanent would be destroyed again. <br>6/15/2010 : Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and that Aura has gained a regeneration shield. The next time the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, the Aura would be destroyed instead -- but it regenerates, so nothing is destroyed at all. Alternately, if that Aura somehow becomes indestructible, the enchanted permanent is effectively indestructible as well. <br>6/15/2010 : If a spell or ability says that it would "destroy" a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, that spell or ability causes the Aura to be destroyed instead. (This matters for cards such as Karmic Justice.) Totem armor doesn't destroy the Aura; rather, it changes the effects of the spell or ability. On the other hand, if a spell or ability deals lethal damage to a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, the game rules regarding lethal damage cause the Aura to be destroyed, not that spell or ability. <br>6/15/2010 : All _Rise of the Eldrazi_ cards printed with totem armor are Auras with "enchant creature." But Umbra Mystic grants totem armor to Auras attached to any permanent you control, not just creatures. The ability works the same way even if the Aura is enchanting a land, an artifact, or any other permanent. <br>6/15/2010 : Umbra Mystic grants totem armor to Auras attached to permanents you control, regardless of who controls those Auras. Conversely, it doesn't grant totem armor to Auras you control that are attached to permanents controlled by other players. <br>6/15/2010 : If a permanent you control would be destroyed, and it's enchanted by an Aura with totem armor, it doesn't matter who controls that Aura. The totem armor effect is mandatory. If that permanent is enchanted by multiple Auras, you choose which one is destroyed, regardless of who controls them. <br>6/15/2010 : Say you control a permanent that's enchanted by an Aura you control, and that Aura is itself enchanted by an Aura. If the permanent would be destroyed, instead the first Aura is destroyed... but since that Aura would be destroyed, instead the second Aura is destroyed. <br>6/15/2010 : Multiple instances of totem armor on the same Aura are redundant.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[193456]]></id><name><![CDATA[Unified Will]]></name><set><![CDATA[ROE]]></set><type><![CDATA[Instant]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[U]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{1}{U}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[2]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Counter target spell if you control more creatures than that spell's controller.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA["We're glad to be of service—to be an audience to your failure."<br>—Maizah Shere, Tazeem lullmage]]></flavor><artist><![CDATA[Matt Cavotta]]></artist><number><![CDATA[92]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[<br>6/15/2010 : Whether you control more creatures than the targeted spell's controller is checked only as Unified Will resolves.

The spell is simply put into your graveyard. You won't get to cast it again next turn. <br>6/15/2010 : If you cast a spell with rebound from anywhere other than your hand (such as from your graveyard due to Sins of the Past, from your library due to cascade, or from your opponent's hand due to Sen Triplets), rebound won't have any effect. If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel). <br>6/15/2010 : If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves. <br>6/15/2010 : Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand. <br>6/15/2010 : If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard. Rather, it's exiled directly from the stack. Effects that care about cards being put into your graveyard won't do anything. <br>6/15/2010 : At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law). <br>6/15/2010 : If you are unable to cast a card from exile this way, or you choose not to, nothing happens when the delayed triggered ability resolves. The card remains exiled for the rest of the game, and you won't get another chance to cast the card. The same is true if the ability is countered (due to Stifle, perhaps). <br>6/15/2010 : If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to your graveyard when it resolves or is countered. It won't go back to exile. <br>6/15/2010 : As long as World at War resolves before the first postcombat main phase of a turn ends, it will have its full effect. That will happen in most cases, since it's a sorcery (meaning it's probably cast during the first or second main phase of a turn), and it has rebound (meaning it'll be cast during your upkeep). If, however, it's cast later than that, it won't create any new phases. For example, if one World at War creates a second combat phase and a third main phase in a turn, then a second World at War is cast during that third main phase, no additional phases are created. The rebound effect still works, though. <br>6/15/2010 : Multiple World at War effects are cumulative, as long as they're cast early enough. The first one modifies the turn structure to this: beginning phase, precombat main phase, combat phase, postcombat main phase, [new combat phase], [new postcombat main phase], ending phase. Each subsequent one inserts another combat phase and main phase into the turn after the original postcombat main phase and before the newest combat phase. <br>6/15/2010 : Unlike other similar cards (such as Relentless Assault), World at War doesn't untap the creatures that have attacked this turn when it resolves. Rather, those creatures untap when the new combat phase created by the spell begins. All creatures that attacked this turn untap, regardless of which combat phase they attacked in (if there have been more than one) or who controls them (if you're playing a Two-Headed Giant game, for example). <br>6/15/2010 : You don't have to attack with any creatures during the new combat phase.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[193563]]></id><name><![CDATA[Wrap in Flames]]></name><set><![CDATA[ROE]]></set><type><![CDATA[Sorcery]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{3}{R}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[4]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Wrap in Flames deals 1 damage to each of up to three target creatures.

The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it. <br>6/15/2010 : Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. <br>6/15/2010 : If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities -- including those represented by level symbols -- are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy. <br>6/15/2010 : A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[205927]]></id><name><![CDATA[Forest]]></name><set><![CDATA[ROE]]></set><type><![CDATA[Basic Land —
