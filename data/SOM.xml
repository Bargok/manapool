If you choose not to exile it, or you can't exile it because the card has somehow left the graveyard before the ability resolves, the ability simply doesn't do anything as it resolves.

You put the triggered abilities on the stack in any order, so you'll determine in which order they resolve. However, since exiling those cards is optional, and choosing to exile a card this way causes the previously exiled cards to return to their owners' graveyards, the order generally doesn't matter: You'll wind up with at most one of those cards exiled, and the rest will be in the appropriate graveyards. <br>1/1/2011 : You may exile a noncreature card with Mimic Vat's first ability. For example, if a nontoken artifact that's become a creature is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, Mimic Vat's first ability triggers and you may exile that card. <br>1/1/2011 : The token created by the second ability will be a copy of whatever card is exiled with Mimic Vat at the time the ability resolves.

If no card has been exiled with Mimic Vat by the time the ability resolves, no token will be created. <br>1/1/2011 : If the exiled card has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be 0. <br>1/1/2011 : Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the exiled card will trigger when the token is put onto the battlefield.

As the token is created, it checks the printed values of the Myr Propagator it's copying -- or, if the Myr Propagator whose ability was activated was itself a token, the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield -- as well as any copy effects that have been applied to it.

If any copy effects have affected the Myr Propagator whose ability was activated, they're taken into account when the token is created. For example: If Myr Propagator's ability is activated, then Myr Propagator temporarily becomes a copy of another creature before its ability resolves (due to Cytoshape, perhaps), the token will be a copy of whatever creature the Myr Propagator is currently a copy of. After the turn ends, the Cytoshaped Myr Propagator reverts back to what it was, but the token will stay as it is. Also, if the copy ability of a creature (such as Cemetery Puca, perhaps) makes it become a copy of Myr Propagator and gain another ability, the token created by this creature's ability will be a Myr Propagator with that additional ability.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[215114]]></id><name><![CDATA[Myr Reservoir]]></name><set><![CDATA[SOM]]></set><type><![CDATA[Artifact]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[R]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{3}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[3]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[{T}: Add {2} to your mana pool.

They don't get a greater cost reduction. <br>1/1/2011 : Semblance Anvil takes the total cost to cast a spell into account, not just its mana cost. This includes additional costs (such as kicker) and alternative costs (such as evoke). It also includes cost increases from other sources (such as Lodestone Golem's ability). <br>1/1/2011 : Semblance Anvil won't affect the part of a spell's cost represented by colored mana symbols. For example, a spell that normally costs {1}{U} to cast would cost {U} if it shared a card type with the exiled card. <br>1/1/2011 : Semblance Anvil can reduce the amount you pay for a spell's cost that includes {X}. For example, Blaze is a sorcery that costs {X}{R}. If the card exiled with Semblance Anvil is a sorcery, and you want to cast Blaze with X equal to 5, you'll have to pay only {3}{R}. This is true even if the ability states that {X} must be paid with a certain color of mana (as Drain Life does). <br>1/1/2011 : Semblance Anvil's cost reduction effect is mandatory.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[194201]]></id><name><![CDATA[Shape Anew]]></name><set><![CDATA[SOM]]></set><type><![CDATA[Sorcery]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[R]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{3}{U}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[4]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[The controller of target artifact sacrifices it, then reveals cards from the top of his or her library until he or she reveals an artifact card.

The primary difference between them is that emblems aren't permanents and don't exist on the battlefield. Nothing in the game can remove an emblem, simply because no other spell or ability references them. Once you get an emblem, you keep it for the rest of the game. Emblems have no color, name, card type, or other characteristics beyond the listed ability <br>1/1/2011 : The first ability can target any permanent you own, including those another player controls. <br>1/1/2011 : If the first ability exiles a token, that token will cease to exist. It won't return to the battlefield. <br>1/1/2011 : A permanent exiled by the first ability will return to the battlefield under your control at the beginning of the next end step even if you no longer control Venser at that time. <br>1/1/2011 : Venser's second ability doesn't lock in what it applies to. That's because the effect states a true thing about creatures, but doesn't actually change the characteristics of those creatures. As a result, all creatures are unblockable that turn, including creatures you don't control, creatures that weren't on the battlefield at the time the ability resolved, and creatures that have lost all abilities. <br>1/1/2011 : Venser's last ability creates an emblem with a triggered ability. The emblem is the source of the triggered ability. Because emblems are colorless, you can target permanents with protection from white or from blue, for example, with the triggered ability. <br>1/1/2011 : Whenever you cast a spell, the emblem's ability triggers and goes on the stack on top of it. It will resolve before the spell does. <br>1/1/2011 : If you control more than one such emblem, each one's ability will trigger separately whenever you cast a spell.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[215079]]></id><name><![CDATA[Venser's Journal]]></name><set><![CDATA[SOM]]></set><type><![CDATA[Artifact]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[R]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{5}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[5]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[You have no maximum hand size.<br>At the beginning of your upkeep, you gain 1 life for each card in your hand.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[A Planeswalker's chronicle spans worlds and civilizations, each page a lifetime.]]></flavor><artist><![CDATA[Christopher Moeller]]></artist><number><![CDATA[220]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[<br>1/1/2011 : If multiple effects modify your hand size, apply them in timestamp order.
