It doesn't matter whether an opponent has 0 or less life, an opponent is forced to draw a card while his or her library is empty, an opponent has ten or more poison counters, an opponent is dealt combat damage by Phage the Untouchable, you control Felidar Sovereign and have 40 or more life, or so on. You keep playing. <br>3/1/2010 : Other circumstances can still cause an opponent to lose the game, however. An opponent will lose a game if he or she concedes, if that player is penalized with a Game Loss or a Match Loss during a sanctioned tournament due to a DCI rules infraction, or if that player's _Magic Online_(R) game clock runs out of time. <br>3/1/2010 : Effects that say the game is a draw, such as the _Legends_(TM) card Divine Intervention, are not affected by Abyssal Persecutor. <br>3/1/2010 : Abyssal Persecutor won't preclude an opponent's life total from reaching 0 or less. It will just preclude that player from losing the game as a result. <br>3/1/2010 : If Abyssal Persecutor leaves the battlefield while an opponent has 0 or less life, that opponent will lose the game as a state-based action. No player can respond between the time Abyssal Persecutor leaves the battlefield and the time that player loses the game. <br>3/1/2010 : Even though your opponents can't lose the game, a player can't pay an amount of life that's greater than his or her life total. If a player's life total is 0 or less, that player can't pay life at all, with one exception: a player may always pay 0 life. <br>3/1/2010 : If you control Abyssal Persecutor in a Two-Headed Giant game, your team can't win the game and the opposing team can't lose the game.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[197160]]></id><name><![CDATA[Admonition Angel]]></name><set><![CDATA[WWK]]></set><type><![CDATA[Creature — Angel]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[M]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{3}{W}{W}{W}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[6]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[6]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[6]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Flying<br>Landfall — Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, you may exile target nonland permanent other than Admonition Angel.<br>When Admonition Angel leaves the battlefield, return all cards exiled with it to the battlefield under their owners' control.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[]]></flavor><artist><![CDATA[Steve Argyle]]></artist><number><![CDATA[1]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[<br>3/1/2010 : The landfall ability triggerss whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason.

The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types.

The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types.

This can happen if a Zendikon enchanting an attacking or blocking creature leaves the battlefield, for example. The permanent that was removed from combat neither deals nor is dealt combat damage. Any attacking creature that the land creature was blocking remains blocked, however. <br>3/1/2010 : An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature's power and toughness. If the land was already a creature (due to a Zendikon already enchanting it or its animation ability resolving earlier in the turn, for example), this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modified its power or toughness, such as the effects of Disfigure or Glorious Anthem, will continue to apply, no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. <br>3/1/2010 : If a Zendikon and the land it's enchanting are destroyed at the same time (due to Akroma's Vengeance, for example), the Zendikon's last ability will still trigger. <br>3/1/2010 : If a Zendikon's last ability triggers, but the land card it refers to leaves the graveyard before it resolves, it will resolve but do nothing. <br>3/1/2010 : Each time you activate Raging Ravine's last ability, it gains an instance of the triggered ability "Whenever this creature attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on it."

For example, if the chosen source is Earthquake, you might choose to prevent the next 2 damage it would deal to you and the next 1 damage it would deal to a creature you control. You don't decide until the point at which the source would deal its damage. <br>3/1/2010 : Refraction Trap's effect is not a redirection effect. If it prevents damage, Refraction Trap (not the chosen source) deals damage to the targeted creature or player as part of that prevention effect. Refraction Trap is the source of the new damage, so the characteristics of the original source (such as its color, or whether it had lifelink or deathtouch) don't affect this damage. The new damage is not combat damage, even if the prevented damage was. Since you control the source of the new damage, if you targeted an opponent with Refraction Trap, you may have Refraction Trap deal its damage to a planeswalker that opponent controls. <br>3/1/2010 : If the chosen source would deal damage, Refraction Trap prevents 3 of that source's damage and the source deals its excess damage (if any) at the same time. Immediately afterward, as part of that same prevention effect, Refraction Trap deals its damage. This happens before state-based actions are checked, and before the spell or ability that caused damage to be dealt resumes its resolution. <br>3/1/2010 : Whether the targeted creature or player is still a legal target is no longer checked after Refraction Trap resolves. For example, if a creature targeted by Refraction Trap gains shroud after Refraction Trap resolves but before it prevents damage, Refraction Trap will still prevent damage and still deal damage to that creature. If Refraction Trap can't deal damage to the targeted creature or player (because the creature has gained protection from white, is no longer on the battlefield, or is no longer a creature, or the player is no longer in the game, for example), it will still prevent damage. It just won't deal any damage itself. <br>3/1/2010 : If Refraction Trap doesn't prevent any damage (perhaps because a different prevention effect is applied to the damage the source would deal, or because the damage is unpreventable), Refraction Trap won't deal any damage itself.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[189180]]></id><name><![CDATA[Rest for the Weary]]></name><set><![CDATA[WWK]]></set><type><![CDATA[Instant]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{1}{W}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[2]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Target player gains 4 life.<br>Landfall — If you had a land enter the battlefield under your control this turn, that player gains 8 life instead.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[Zendikar is a brutal taskmaster, but sometimes it offers unexpected solace.]]></flavor><artist><![CDATA[James Paick]]></artist><number><![CDATA[18]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[191549]]></id><name><![CDATA[Ricochet Trap]]></name><set><![CDATA[WWK]]></set><type><![CDATA[Instant — Trap]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[U]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{3}{R}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[4]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[If an opponent cast a blue spell this turn, you may pay {R} rather than pay Ricochet Trap's mana cost.<br>Change the target of target spell with a single target.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[In his last seconds, Remhas regretted using his most powerful spell.]]></flavor><artist><![CDATA[Jaime Jones]]></artist><number><![CDATA[87]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[<br>3/1/2010 : If you cast Ricochet Trap for {R}, you don't have to target the blue spell an opponent cast. <br>3/1/2010 : Ricochet Trap targets only the spell whose target will be changed.

The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. <br>3/1/2010 : If a Zendikon and the land it's enchanting are destroyed at the same time (due to Akroma's Vengeance, for example), the Zendikon's last ability will still trigger. <br>3/1/2010 : If a Zendikon's last ability triggers, but the land card it refers to leaves the graveyard before it resolves, it will resolve but do nothing.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[189162]]></id><name><![CDATA[Wolfbriar Elemental]]></name><set><![CDATA[WWK]]></set><type><![CDATA[Creature — Elemental]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[R]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{2}{G}{G}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[4]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[4]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[4]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Multikicker {G} (You may pay an additional {G} any number of times as you cast this spell.)<br>When Wolfbriar Elemental enters the battlefield, put a 2/2 green Wolf creature token onto the battlefield for each time it was kicked.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[]]></flavor><artist><![CDATA[Chippy]]></artist><number><![CDATA[118]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[197840]]></id><name><![CDATA[Wrexial, the Risen Deep]]></name><set><![CDATA[WWK]]></set><type><![CDATA[Legendary Creature — Kraken]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[M]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{3}{U}{U}{B}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[6]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[5]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[8]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Islandwalk, swampwalk<br>Whenever Wrexial, the Risen Deep deals combat damage to a player, you may cast target instant or sorcery card from that player's graveyard without paying its mana cost.
