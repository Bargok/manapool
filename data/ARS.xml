Suppose a Lava Axe would deal 5 damage to a player who has cast Mending Hands targeting him or herself.

Your permanents untap just once during that step, no matter how many opponents you have. <br>6/15/2010 : During an opponent's untap step, effects that would otherwise cause your permanents to stay tapped don't apply because they apply only during *your* untap step. For example, if you control a Deep-Slumber Titan (a creature that says "Deep-Slumber Titan doesn't untap during your untap step"), you untap Deep-Slumber Titan during each opponent's untap step. <br>6/15/2010 : Controlling more than one face-up I Know All, I See All card is redundant.

It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or whether it's been affected by any noncopy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on. <br>6/15/2010 : If the targeted permanent is copying something else when the ability resolves (for example, if it's a Clone), then the token enters the battlefield as a copy of whatever that permanent is copying. <br>6/15/2010 : If the targeted permanent is a token, the new token copies the characteristics of the original token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield. <br>6/15/2010 : If the targeted permanent has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be zero. <br>6/15/2010 : Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the targeted permanent will trigger when the token is put onto the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of that permanent will also work. <br>6/15/2010 : If the targeted permanent leaves the battlefield before the ability resolves, the ability is countered. You don't get a token. <br>6/15/2010 : If the targeted permanent is legendary or is a planeswalker, that permanent and the token will both be put into the graveyard as a state-based action. You don't get a chance to activate any of the token's abilities. <br>6/15/2010 : If the targeted permanent is an Aura, you choose a legal permanent, player, or other card for the token to enchant as it enters the battlefield. A permanent you choose must be able to be enchanted by the token. (For example, if the Aura it's copying is red and has "enchant creature," the permanent must be a creature, and it can't have protection from red.) Since the token Aura wasn't cast as a spell, it doesn't target what it will enchant; you may choose something that has shroud, for example. As the ability resolves, no player can respond between the time you choose what the token will enchant and the time it enters the battlefield. If you can't choose something for the token to enchant, it enters the battlefield unattached, then is put into your graveyard as a state-based action.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[212582]]></id><name><![CDATA[Into the Earthen Maw]]></name><set><![CDATA[ARS]]></set><type><![CDATA[Scheme]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[0]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[When you set this scheme in motion, exile up to one target creature with flying, up to one target creature without flying, and all cards from up to one target opponent's graveyard.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA["You may even see them again.

Effectively, that means it removes your maximum hand size just during the turn in which you set it in motion. <br>6/15/2010 : If multiple effects modify your hand size, apply them in timestamp order. For example, if you put Null Profusion (an enchantment that says your maximum hand size is two) onto the battlefield and later set this scheme in motion, you'll have no maximum hand size until your next turn. However, if you set this scheme in motion and then put Null Profusion onto the battlefield that turn, your maximum hand size would be two.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[212609]]></id><name><![CDATA[Your Will Is Not Your Own]]></name><set><![CDATA[ARS]]></set><type><![CDATA[Scheme]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[0]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[When you set this scheme in motion, gain control of target creature an opponent controls until end of turn.
