It affects creatures that would enter the battlefield under any opponent's control. <br>10/1/2008 : Gather Specimens affects both token creatures and nontoken creatures. It affects creatures that would enter the battlefield by any means. This includes, of course, creature spells that resolve. It also includes creatures put onto the battlefield as a result of a resolving spell (such as Call of the Herd or Zombify), resolving ability (such as Verdant Force's ability or Doomed Necromancer's ability), cost (such as Varchild's War-Riders's cumulative upkeep cost), replacement effect (such as the one created by Words of Wilding), or any other means. <br>10/1/2008 : If a creature spell controlled by an opponent would resolve, it resolves, but the creature enters the battlefield under your control instead of the opponent's control. Choices made when casting that spell (such as whether it was kicked or the value of X in the spell's cost) are remembered. Any "enters the battlefield" triggered abilities will trigger after the creature is on the battlefield under your control. <br>10/1/2008 : The Gather Specimens replacement effect is applied before any other replacement effects that would also modify how the creature enters the battlefield. These are usually worded "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or “[this creature] enters the battlefield with.” For example, if your Gather Specimens has resolved, then the following things are true:-- If a creature with devour would enter the battlefield under an opponent's control, you choose and sacrifice your creatures as it enters the battlefield under your control.-- If Voice of All would enter the battlefield under an opponent's control, you choose a color as it enters the battlefield under your control.-- If Clone would enter the battlefield under an opponent's control, you choose which creature it copies as it enters the battlefield under your control.-- If a Wizard would enter the battlefield under an opponent's control and that player controls Sage of Fables, the Wizard will not enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it as it enters the battlefield under your control.-- If a Wizard would enter the battlefield under an opponent's control and you control Sage of Fables, the Wizard will enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it as it enters the battlefield under your control. <br>10/1/2008 : Gather Specimens won't retroactively change the control of creatures that have already enter the battlefield that turn. <br>10/1/2008 : Some effects that put creatures onto the battlefield continue to affect those creatures later on. Although Gather Specimens changes whose control the creature enters the battlefield under, the rest of the effect works as normal. For example, if your opponent activates a creature card's unearth ability and you cast Gather Specimens, that creature enters the battlefield under your control, but the rest of the unearth ability is unchanged. The creature has haste. It's exiled at the beginning of the end step. If it would leave the battlefield, it’s exiled instead of being put anywhere else. <br>10/1/2008 : If the effect that puts a creature onto the battlefield also creates a delayed triggered ability, Gather Specimens doesn't change who controls that ability. In the unearth example above, your opponent controls the ability that exiles the creature at the beginning of the end step. On the other hand, if the effect that puts a creature onto the battlefield grants a triggered ability to the creature (with "gains" or "has"), the player who controls the creature at the time the ability triggers will be the player who controls that ability. For example, if your opponent casts Makeshift Mannequin and you cast Gather Specimens in response, the creature will return to the battlefield under your control with a mannequin counter and it will have the ability "When this creature becomes the target of a spell or ability, sacrifice it." If the ability triggers, you'll control it, so you'll have to sacrifice the creature. <br>10/1/2008 : If two or more players have each cast Gather Specimens during the same turn and a creature would enter the battlefield, the creature's would-be controller (the controller of the creature spell, for example) chooses one of the applicable Gather Specimens to apply. Then the new would-be controller of the creature repeats this process among the remaining Gather Specimens, and so on, until there are no more possible Gather Specimens effects to apply. <br>10/1/2008 : The above procedure means that if two opposing players have each cast Gather Specimens during the same turn and a creature would enter the battlefield under the control of one of them, it really will enter the battlefield under that player's control. (The creature would enter the battlefield under player A's control, so player B's Gather Specimens affects it. Now that creature would enter the battlefield under player B's control, so player A's Gather Specimens affects it. Each replacement effect has now been used, so the creature will enter the battlefield under player A's control.)]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[175036]]></id><name><![CDATA[Gift of the Gargantuan]]></name><set><![CDATA[ALA]]></set><type><![CDATA[Sorcery]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{2}{G}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[3]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Look at the top four cards of your library.

Unlike most artifacts, a colored artifact requires colored mana to cast. Also unlike most artifacts, a colored artifact has a color in all zones. It will interact with cards that care about color. Other than that, a colored artifact behaves just like any other artifact. It will interact as normal with any card that cares about artifacts, such as Shatter or Arcbound Ravager. <br>10/1/2008 : The first ability exiles two cards in your graveyard as a cost. You can't activate this ability unless you have at least two cards in your graveyard. Exiling those two cards can't be responded to. <br>10/1/2008 : The second ability prevents all damage that would be dealt to you, regardless of how many cards are in your graveyard. For example, if you have three cards in your graveyard and would be dealt 5 damage, Immortal Coil prevents all 5 damage and exiles all the cards in your graveyard. <br>10/1/2008 : The third ability checks whether your graveyard is empty only at the time it triggers. Putting a card into your graveyard after that doesn't help. You'll lose the game when the ability resolves. <br>10/1/2008 : If the third ability is countered, but your graveyard is still empty, the ability will immediately trigger again. <br>10/1/2008 : If the third ability is countered, but your graveyard is still empty, the ability will immediately trigger again. <br>10/1/2008 : Similarly, if the third ability resolves but you don't lose the game for some reason (because you control Platinum Angel, perhaps), it will immediately trigger again if your graveyard is still empty. Immortal Coil + Platinum Angel + an empty graveyard is an involuntary infinite loop. Unless a player disrupts it, the game will end in a draw. <br>10/1/2008 : Suppose you control Immortal Coil and a planeswalker, and a source controlled by an opponent would deal noncombat damage to you. Both Immortal Coil and the planeswalker have effects that could affect that damage. You choose one to apply.-- If you apply Immortal Coil's effect, the damage is prevented. The planeswalker replacement effect is no longer applicable.-- If you apply the planeswalker replacement effect, your opponent then chooses whether he or she wants to redirect the damage to your planeswalker. If your opponent does, then that many loyalty counters are removed from the planeswalker, and Immortal Coil's effect is no longer applicable. If your opponent doesn't, then Immortal Coil's effect applies and the damage is prevented.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[174806]]></id><name><![CDATA[Incurable Ogre]]></name><set><![CDATA[ALA]]></set><type><![CDATA[Creature — Ogre Mutant]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{3}{R}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[4]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[5]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[1]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[Each mutation causes the incurables to look vastly different from one another.

For example, if your life total is 20 and your library has thirty-two cards in it when Invincible Hymn resolves, Invincible Hymn will cause you to gain 12 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with Invincible Hymn accordingly. <br>6/15/2010 : In a Two-Headed Giant game, Invincible Hymn will essentially set your team's life total to the number of cards in your library.

If a player wins the game, the game ends immediately. <br>10/1/2008 : Lich's Mirror has no effect if you concede the game. If you concede, you'll lose. <br>10/1/2008 : If you can't lose the game (for example, you control a Platinum Angel), Lich's Mirror won't do anything. <br>10/1/2008 : Lich's Mirror shuffles permanents you own into your library, regardless of who controls them. <br>10/1/2008 : Lich's Mirror shuffles tokens you own into your library, too. The tokens you own will leave play. However, there's no point to physically shuffling tokens into your library because you can't draw them as part of Lich's Mirror's effect and they'll cease to exist immediately afterwards. <br>10/1/2008 : Any abilities that trigger when the permanents leave the battlefield will be put on the stack after Lich's Mirror's entire effect has been applied. <br>10/1/2008 : Lich's Mirror doesn't affect spells on the stack, cards that have been exiled, or permanents you control but don't own. They'll stay where they are. Spells on the stack will then resolve as normal. <br>10/1/2008 : Although Lich's Mirror has you draw a hand of seven cards and sets your life total to 20, this isn't a game restart. You can't take a mulligan if you don't like your new hand of cards. <br>10/1/2008 : For your life total to become 20, you actually gain or lose the necessary amount of life. Keep in mind that you may have a negative life total when this happens. For example, if your life total is -4 when you would lose the game, Lich's Mirror's effect will cause you to gain 24 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly. <br>10/1/2008 : As part of Lich's Mirror's effect, it typically shuffles itself into your library. If it does, that means that if you'd lose the game *again* immediately after its effect is finished, it can't help you a second time. This can occur in a few different ways. For example:-- You have ten or more poison counters. Lich's Mirror doesn't remove poison counters. If you'd lose the game this way, you'll do what Lich's Mirror says, then you'll lose the game the next time state-based actions are checked.-- Your life total is 0 or less and an effect says that you can't gain life. Since your life total can't be raised, it stays at whatever it is rather than becoming 20, and you'll lose the game the next time state-based actions are checked.-- The number of nontoken permanents you own plus the number of cards in your hand, graveyard, and library is less than seven. When you try to draw seven cards as part of Lich's Mirror's effect, you'll be unable to complete at least one of those draws and you'll lose the game the next time state-based actions are checked.-- You control *but don't own* a permanent such as Immortal Coil with a triggered ability that causes you to lose the game when a certain game state happens (also known as a "state trigger"), and the condition that causes the "lose the game" ability to trigger hasn't changed. If you owned the permanent, Lich's Mirror would shuffle it into your library. In this case, however, it remains on the battlefield and its ability will trigger again. <br>10/1/2008 : If you control *but don't own* Lich's Mirror, Lich's Mirror itself will still be on the battlefield after its effect is finished. If you would lose the game again for any of the reasons above, Lich's Mirror has its effect again . . . and again . . . and again. An involuntary infinite loop will be created, and the game will end in a draw. (In the case of the triggered ability example given last in the list above, it's possible that a player could cause the loop to end while the ability is on the stack. None of the loops caused by state-based actions can be stopped at all.) <br>10/1/2008 : If all the players remaining in a game would lose simultaneously but one of them controls Lich's Mirror, that player does what Lich's Mirror says instead of losing, and everyone else loses. As a result, the controller of Lich's Mirror wins the game because all of his or her opponents have lost. (If Lich's Mirror weren't in the picture, then the game would be a draw.) <br>10/1/2008 : If a spell causes you to lose the game the next time state-based actions are checked (by dealing damage to you greater than your life total, for example), that spell will already be in the graveyard by the time Lich's Mirror's effect happens. If it's in your graveyard, it will be shuffled into your library. <br>10/1/2008 : If, during a check of state-based actions, you'd lose the game at the same time a creature you own would be put into your graveyard (due to an Earthquake for 10 or combat damage dealt to both you and the creature, for example), that creature's controller has a choice to make. The state-based actions rule is trying to simultaneously (a) shuffle that creature card into your library (due to Lich's Mirror's replacement effect) and (b) put it into your graveyard. Only one of those things can happen. The creature's controller chooses which one. If the creature is put into your graveyard, it isn't shuffled into your library. Abilities that trigger when that creature is put into a graveyard will trigger only if that option is chosen. <br>10/1/2008 : If, during a check of state-based actions, you'd lose the game for multiple reasons (for example, if you were at 1 life and had one card in your library, then Night's Whisper caused you to draw two cards and lose 2 life), a single Lich's Mirror will replace all of them. You’ll do what Lich's Mirror says just once. <br>10/1/2009 : A token's owner is the player under whose control it entered the battlefield. <br>6/15/2010 : In a Two-Headed Giant game, if your team would lose the game and you control Lich's Mirror, your team won't lose. Instead, you'll do what Lich's Mirror says and your teammate won't do anything. This is true even if the reason your team would lose is because your teammate tried to draw a card with an empty library or was affected by an ability that said he or she lost the game. Your life total (which is the same as your team's life total) becomes 20. Your team's life total is adjusted by the amount of life you gain or lose as a result of this, which basically means your team's life total becomes 20.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[176446]]></id><name><![CDATA[Lightning Talons]]></name><set><![CDATA[ALA]]></set><type><![CDATA[Enchantment — Aura]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{2}{R}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[3]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Enchant creature<br>Enchanted creature gets +3/+0 and has first strike.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA["This is going to hurt a lot, but on the bright side, you'll be dead soon."<br>—Sedris, the Traitor King]]></flavor><artist><![CDATA[Pete Venters]]></artist><number><![CDATA[107]]></number><ruling><![CDATA[]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[176441]]></id><name><![CDATA[Lush Growth]]></name><set><![CDATA[ALA]]></set><type><![CDATA[Enchantment — Aura]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[C]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{G}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[1]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Enchant land<br>Enchanted land is a Mountain, Forest, and Plains.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[Naya's bounty spills over upon itself.

Once the ability triggers, it will resolve no matter what the creature's power may become while the ability is on the stack.]]></ruling></card><card><id><![CDATA[175385]]></id><name><![CDATA[Mindlock Orb]]></name><set><![CDATA[ALA]]></set><type><![CDATA[Artifact]]></type><rarity><![CDATA[R]]></rarity><manacost><![CDATA[{3}{U}]]></manacost><converted_manacost><![CDATA[4]]></converted_manacost><power><![CDATA[]]></power><toughness><![CDATA[]]></toughness><loyalty><![CDATA[]]></loyalty><ability><![CDATA[Players can't search libraries.]]></ability><flavor><![CDATA[Rogue mechanists once rummaged through the wastes of the Tidehollow, constructing unauthorized golems to threaten the hegemony of the sphinxes.

After combat damage is dealt, Quietus Spike looks at that player's life total (which is the same as the team's life total) when determining how much life the team will lose, which basically means the team's life total is halved. Here's an example of the math: The team has 19 life, so the player has 19 life. Quietus Spike causes the team to lose 10 life (19 divided by 2, rounded up).
